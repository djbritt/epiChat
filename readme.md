## Daniel Britt Project 2 Handin 2

### Theme :snowflake:
The theme for this chat application is what I call epichat!
It is a fun little chat app theme, that has an epic way of delivering messages with whoever is connected, or to chat with a chatbot.

### Theme Incorporation :cyclone:
For incorporating the theme, I created a logo that says epichat and sits in the top left of the page.
The message box in the center is 50% of the screen, it shows the messages nicely displayed inside with hr under every message to separate them.
The gray background for the page I feel gives the chat a nice mood, and allows for long hours of chatting!

### Problems :anger:
There are two problems I am dealing with, which are more or less based off one another.
The main problem is that I cannot store two people logged into the chat app at once.
Sure, if another person logs in, they can send messages, but the second person overwrites the first person's login details.
The second problem based off this problem is that I don't have a constant user list, because I have no way of knowing who has logged in, and is still currently logged in.

### Improvements :heavy_plus_sign:
I would liked to have made the sections of my chat application look more like a chat app.
I could have achieved this by having different square sections throughout the site that has different kinds of information in it, like the user list, and login or out buttons.
It also would have been nice to have this implemented into an actual web page, with one part of the site having a chat area.
